                “Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement.”
                - W. Clement Stone

                Just as with all forms of life, the purpose of life for man is also to grow. Discovering, cultivating,
                and
                expressing your natural potential toward goals that are meaningful to you, will improve your life and
                the
                world around you.



                This implies that you know what your natural talents are and have decided what you will work towards.
